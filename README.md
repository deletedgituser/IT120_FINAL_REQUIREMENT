## 📖 Introduction
Welcome to the **Secure Messaging App**!  
This project demonstrates secure communication by employing encryption and decryption of messages. Built with Django and Django REST Framework (DRF), it offers secure APIs, token-based authorization, and user authentication to ensure the confidentiality of messages.

## ✨ Features
- **🔐 Secure Communication**: Messages are encrypted and decrypted for safe transmission using AES.
- **🔑 Token-Based Authorization**: Ensures secure access to API endpoints.
- **👤 User Authentication**: Provides login and secure user management.
- **🛠️ Modular Design**: Divided into server-side and client-side applications for scalability.

## 🧩 The project consists of two applications:
1. **🖥️ Server-Side**: Provides API endpoints for user registration, login, sending messages, and viewing inbox messages. Also includes an admin dashboard to manage users and messages.
2. **📱 Client-Side**: Interacts with the `server_side` application by making API calls to perform the aforementioned actions.
